                <p>My name is Alexander Obaseki, currently a student at the University of Minnesota coding boot camp. I have been facsinated by technology since I was a kid, no since I was a baby. I remember wondering how cars moved around without visible electrical wires hanging out from their rear, then I also thought that will be a difficult and  convuluted arrangement to manage owning to the fact that quite a few people had cars in my neighborhood at the time. Children's thought right, I know.</p> <br>
                <p> I initially was interested in Petroleum Engineering(the biggest industry in my native Nigeria) and then Mechanical Engineering, however somehow I found myself enrolled for a Computer Engineering program(the only available associate degree at the time at college closest to me). Then I fell in love with computers after taking courses in Microprocessors and Microcomputers.Even without computers to play around with my interest in Information and Communication Technology remained as witted as when I first took those classes as teenager.</p><br>
                <p>I have an associate in Computer Engineering, Bachelors in Computer Science, and a Master of Engineering in Computer Software and Theory. I also studied some Chinese along the way from my time in China.</p><br>
                <p>I love traveling, though I haven't done much in that area, I would love to travel the world some day. I love learning, all sort of things, from Medicine, to Geography, to History (kind of jack of all trade and master of none).</p><br>
