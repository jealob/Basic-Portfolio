                <p>My name is Alexander Obaseki, currently a student at the University of Minnesota coding boot camp. I have been facsinated by technology since I was a kid, I remember wondering how cars moved around without visible electrical wires hanging out from their rear, then I also thought that will be a convuluted arrangement to foster own to the fact that quite a few people cars in my neighborhood at the time. Children thought right, I know.</p>

                <p> I initially was interested in Petroleum Engineering(the biggest industry in my native Nigeria) and then Mechanical Engineering, however somehow I found myself enrolled for a Computer Engineering program(the only available associate degree at the time at college closest to me). Then I fell in love with computers after taking courses in Microprocessors and Microcomputers.Even without computers to play around with my interest in Information and Communication Technology remained as witted as when I first took those classes as teenager.</p>

                <p>I love traveling, though I have done much in that area, I would love to travel the world some day. I love learning, all sort of things, from Medicine, to Geography, to History (kind of jack of all trade and master of none).</p>
